# Pylisp
**WARNING: this language is a work in progress, so everything is subject to change. Use it at your own risk.**
My attempt at making a lisp. Was gonna call it "Mylisp" but it's already taken. "Pylisp" because it's similar to "Mylisp" and "Py" is the extension of Python.

## Quick Start
It's, like, just a Python script
```console
$ python3 main.py
```

## Language Reference
TBD
